> Note: paper.jar is 1.12.2, the recommended gwen version

> Note: If you are using Gwen release, paper.jar is not a plugin so do not put it in your plugins folder.

> Note: The plugins folder has EssentialsX plugins. EssentialsX is a fork of Essentials and adds more commands with less lag.

GWEN ANIMATION:
The configs were generated from the plugins.
If you remove the configs it will autogenerate on next start but it wouldnt work with / like gwen.

GWEN in no way should mess with your server. I do not take responsibility for the anticheat plugin or players banned by gwen.
