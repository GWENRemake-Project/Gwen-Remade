> Note: paper.jar is 1.11.2, the recommended gwen version

> Note: If you are using Gwen release, paper.jar is not a plugin so do not put it in your plugins folder.

> Note: The plugins folder has essentials delete your servers essentials and use the essentials provided

> Note: The essentials plugins provided are not regular essentials, they are EssentialsX, a fork of essentials that works better.

GWEN ANIMATION:
The configs were generated from the plugins.
If you remove the configs it will autogenerate on next start but it wouldnt work with (or like) gwen.

GWEN in no way should mess with your server. I do not take responsibility for the anticheat plugin or players banned by gwen.
