```

> Note: paper.jar is 1.11.2, the recommended gwen version

> Note: The plugins folder has essentials delete your servers essentials and use the essentials provided

GWEN ANIMATION:
The configs were generated from the plugins.
If you remove the configs it will autogenerate on next start but it wouldnt work with (or like) gwen.
